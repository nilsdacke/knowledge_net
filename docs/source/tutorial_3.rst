Step 3: a knowledge network
================================

Now for the best part. The central idea with KnowledgeNet is to allow knowledge bases to connect to each other,
forming a network. We'll do that now.

We will create a knowledge base that looks at your query and then, if it seems to apply to the topics of Babbage,
Darwin or Galton, consults with the relevant specialist knowledge base.

To do this, the knowledge base needs descriptions of the knowledge bases to connect with. We provide the information
in a JSON file.

* Descriptions of the knowledge bases to call

Make sure that the knowledge base servers we started are still running. Then run
