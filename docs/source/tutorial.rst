Tutorial overview
================================

In this brief tutorial, we will

* Create conversational knowledge bases
* Serve the knowledge bases over HTTP
* Create a knowledge base that collects information from the others
* Chat with our knowledge bases

All we need is some documents containing the knowledge we want to share.
Here, we will use the writings of three nineteenth century scientists, Charles Darwin, Francis Galton and
Charles Babbage.

The KnowledgeNet framework takes care of everything else. This includes creating the knowledge base and serving it
over HTTP
or, in the near future, other communication protocols. Importantly, the framework supports communication between
knowledge bases. It also provides a user interface for the conversations.
